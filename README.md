## Description

This is a book tracking app that lets you choose books and categorize them onto different shelves: read, want to read, and currently reading. This project was built using the React framework. An [API and client library]( https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) was provided to help persist information as the user interacts with the app.

## How to Run the Web App

1. Download the repository.
2. Open a command prompt terminal and cd (change into the directory) where the repository has been saved.
3. Install all the needed npm dependencies using the following command:
    * `npm install`
    * Note: node.js can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm can subsequently be installed using the instructions found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
4. Start the development server using the following command:
    * `npm start`
5. While the server is running in the background, browse the website at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirements of this project involved:
* Ensuring that the application is easy to install and start.
* Writing a README with easy to understand instructions on how to install and start the project.
* Creating a main page with the following features:
  * Three shelves to display books on: read, want to read, and currently reading.
  * Books with their corresponding titles and authors and placed on the correct shelves.
  * The ability to move books from one shelf to another.
  * The information for each book remains the same even after a browser refresh.
* Creating a search page with the following features:
  * A search input field in which the user can search books by author or title.
  * Search results are cleared when the search input becomes empty.
  * Proper handling of search results when given invalid search queries.
  * Properly display books with partially missing information such as missing book cover thumbnails or missing authors.
  * The ability to search multiple words at a time.
* Setting up routing, which involved:
  * Setting up a link from the main page to the search page.
    * Ensuring that clicking this link displays the search page and changes the URL in the browser’s address bar to /search.
  * Setting up a link from the search page to the main page.
    * Ensuring that clicking this link displays the main page and changes the URL in the browser’s address bar to /.
* Managing state properly by:
  * Ensuring that component state is properly passed down so that child components inherit state from parent components.
  * Modifying state by using `setState()` instead of by modifying it directly.
  * Ensuring that books have the same state on the main page and the search page, especially with regards to which shelves they’re located on.

## Extra Features

Extra features that were added to the web app included:
* TBD

## Backend Server

A [backend server](https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com) was provided by Udacity to work with for this project. The [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) file was also provided and it contains the methods that were needed to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in the app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only.

### Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend provided.
